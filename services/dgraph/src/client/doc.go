/* 
Package client is used to interact with a Dgraph server.  Queries and
mutations can be run from the client.  There are essentially two modes
of client interaction:

- Request based interaction mode where the user program builds requests 
and receives responses immediately after running, and

- Batch mode where clients submit many requests and let the client package
batch those requests to the server.

Request Mode: User programs create a NewDgraphClient, create a request
with req := client.Req{} and then add edges, deletion, schema and
queries to the request with Set, Delete, AddSchema/AddSchemaFromString and
SetQuery/SetQueryWithVariables.  Once the request is built, it is run with
Run.  

Batch Mode:  On creating a new client with NewDgraphClient users submit
BatchMutationOptions specifying the size of batches and number of concurrent 
batches.  Edges are added to the batch with BatchSet; deletions are added
with BatchDelete; and schema mutations with AddSchema.

Submitted mutations are nondeterministically added to batches and there are
no guarantees about which batch a mutation will be scheduled for (e.g. two
successive calls to BatchSet won't guarantee the edges to be in the same batch).

Finishing an interaction with BatchFlush flushes all buffers and ends the
client interaction.
